  <h1>Get Started with Seiso</h1>
</div>

<p>This is a no-nonsense guide to getting up and running with Seiso as quickly as possible. If you need a more general background to Seiso, see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about/">About Seiso</a> page.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle fa-3x"></i></td>
      <td>
        <p>Seiso is alpha software.</p>
        <p>For now, if you want to try it out, you'll have to do "dev mode" stuff, like building from source and running the app locally.</p>
        <p>We'll provide binary downloads and more production-focused resources as the project matures.</p>

    <h1><span class="section-number">1</span> Download Seiso</h1>
  </header>

  <p>For now, it's source only. So get the software by cloning the Git repo. As we get closer to bona fide releases, we'll make binary downloads available.</p>
</section>

    <h1><span class="section-number">2</span> Set up your environment</h1>
  </header>

  <p>Here are some things you'll need to do before you can build and run Seiso.</p>

  <h3>Java:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Install Java 8 if you don't already have it.</li>
    <!--
    <li><span class="label label-primary">Optional</span> If you're interested in contributing to Seiso development and you're using Eclipse Kepler SR2, you'll need to <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/java8/" target="_blank">enable Java 8 support</a>.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-primary">Optional</span> Again, for potential contributors: download and install <a href="http://projectlombok.org/" target="_blank">Project Lombok</a>. The installation allows your IDE to understand Lombok constructions.</li>
    -->
  </ul>

  <h3>Database:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Install MySQL 5.6.x. It may work with other versions; we haven't tried.</li>
    <li>Create the Seiso database schema by running <code>src/main/sql/seiso-schema.sql</code>.</li>
    <li>If you want to load some sample data, run <code>src/main/sql/seiso-data-sample.sql</code>. Eventually we'll make this a web service script instead of a SQL script, but for now it's a SQL script.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>RabbitMQ:</h3>
  <p>Seiso pushes data change notifications out over RabbitMQ. This allows other services to react to changes. It also allows us to push websocket messages to the UI in load-balanced Seiso deployments. So:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Install RabbitMQ.</li>
    <li><span class="label label-primary">Optional</span> For visibility we recommend installing the RabbitMQ management plugin as well.</li>
  </ul>

  <!--
  <h3>Bower:</h3>
  <p>Most people (even most contributors) won't require this, but if you plan to upgrade the web packages at <code>src/main/resources/static/bower</code>, then:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="label label-primary">Optional</span> Install <a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  -->
</section> <!-- end development setup -->

<hr>

<section>
  <header>
    <h1><span class="section-number">3</span> Configure Seiso</h1>
  </header>

  <p>Create copies of the following files from <code>conf-sample</code> and modify them as appropriate:
  <ul>
    <li><code>application.yml</code></li>
    <li><code>keystore-dev.jks</code></li>
    <li><code>log4j.xml</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>To run Seiso in development mode, you can place them directly in <code>src/main/resources</code>.</p>
</section> <!-- end configuration -->

<hr>

<section>
  <header>
    <h1><span class="section-number">4</span> Build Seiso</h1>
  </header>
  
  <p>Build Seiso using Gradle. On *nix:</p>
  
  <pre class="shell">$ ./gradlew clean build</pre>

  <p>If the build succeeds, then you should see a fat, executable JAR at <code>build/libs/seiso-0.2.0.SNAPSHOT.jar</code>. That's the Seiso app.</p>
</section> <!-- end build -->

<hr>
    
<section>
  <header>
    <h1><span class="section-number">5</span> Run Seiso</h1>
  </header>

  <p>You can run Seiso from Gradle like this:</p>

  <pre class="shell">$ ./gradlew bootRun</pre>

  <p>Then point your HTML5-enabled browser to <b>https://localhost:8443</b> or whatever scheme/port combination you happened to choose during configuration.</p>

  <p>You should see a home page with a list of services. Browse around.</p>

  <p>If that worked, congratulations: Seiso is running. To learn how to use the app (whether UI, API or management features), check out the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/current/user-guide/">Seiso User Guide</a>.</p>
